# Jogging

```
  Everyday, in all kinds of weather, thousand of men and women go jogging. Why
has jogging —— running slowly for long distances —— become so popular? Most 
Joggers like it because they have heard it is very good exercise. Jogging makes
the heart strong and help people lose weight. It can also help them feel better
about themselves.
  How fast should you go? Jog with a friend and talk to each other as your fun.
if you have difficuty talking, you are going too fast. How far should you jog?
Remember not to go too far too soon. In fact you should walk not run, the few 
new times. Then do some short jogs, but no more than you can do comfortably.
  After that, increase your distance a quarter or half of a mile every two
weeks or so. Maybe in a few years,you,too,can run in a marathon like thousand of
people do.
