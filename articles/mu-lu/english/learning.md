# Learning

```
   As food is to the body,  so is learning to the mind. Our bodies grow and muscles develop with
the intake of food. Likewise, we should keep learning day by day to maintain our mental power and
expand our intellectual capacity.
    Constant learning supplies us with fuel for driving us to sharpen our power of reasoning, analysis,
and judgement. Continuous learning is the best way to keep pace with the times in the information age.
    It is a common misunderstanding to regard school as the only place for the acquisition of knowledge.
On the contraryï¼Œ learning should be an endless process, from the cradle to the grave. With the word
changing so fast, to stop learngin for just a few days will make a person lag behind.
    Lack of learning will inevitably lead to the stagnation of the mind, or even worse, its fossilization.
Therefore, to stay mentally young we have to take learning as a lifelong career.
