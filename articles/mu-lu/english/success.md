  Success means different things for different people. Some may equate it with fame, 
some with wealth and still some with accompublishments. For me, it means fulfilling 
one's dreams. Whatever your dreams are,you have a goal on it and then focus all 
your attention on it.

  Dreams bring you hope and happiness. In the process of struggling for it, you cry,
sweat,complain or even curse, but the joy of harvesting makes you forget all the pains 
and troubles you have gone through. So an old proverb says that the sweetest fruit is 
one that has undergone the bitterest ordeal.

    There are several keys to success. First, your goal must be practical and practicable, 
if you set your goal too high, chances are that you will never attain it. Next, you have 
to make a plan of doing it. You can take some steps to realize it. Since the process is 
quite tough, you need to be diligent, patient and perserving.

    Even if you meet with some difficulties or frustrations, just take them in your stride. 
You can always tell yourself that there is nothing insurmountable. With this will and 
determination, success is sure to wait for you maat the end of the tunnel!
